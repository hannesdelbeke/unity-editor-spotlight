# Editor Spotlight

Simple MacOS-like Spotlight file search in Unity. It shows your most opened files first. The more you use it, the better it gets.

## How to use
- Open with Alt + F.
- Select a result with arrow keys.
- Press Enter to open the file or Tab to select it in the project panel.

## [UPM](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) Install

```json
"dependencies": {
    "com.seblague.pathcreator": "https://github.com/hannesdelbeke/Path-Creator.git?path=/Assets/PathCreator/Core",  
}
